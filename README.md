Feel free to rate the app and tell your opinion about it. If there is any improvement, bug, or request for new features, you can create new issues.

This project use MVP architecture. I use my [generator-mvp-kotlin](https://github.com/zcabez/generator-mvp-kotlin) library to generate all the library, basic class, folder structure that i need. You can also use the generator i made, go check it out.
## Note to fork
I didn't include the string resource file that hold my GIPHY API KEY to git in order to prevent my api key abuse. if you fork this project and you want to develop it for your own application. you have to create new string resource:
1. create **secrets.xml** in your resource folder. in *values* folder to be precise
2. add new string resource with the name of **giphy_api_key**
```
<resources>
    <string name="giphy_api_key">MY_GIPHY_API_KEY</string>
</resources>
```
